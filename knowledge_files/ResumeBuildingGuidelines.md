# Resume Building Guide

## Objective
Convert JD analysis plus verified corpus evidence into a tailored, ATS-safe resume draft.

## Inputs required
- JD analysis output
- Corpus markdown from `CareerCorpus/corpus.md` (remote or local mirror)
- Section order reference from `/mnt/data/CareerCorpusFormat.md`
- Current user-provided chat facts
- Resume template markdown from `/mnt/data/ResumeTemplate.md`

## Evidence rules
- Every claim must be supported by corpus content or current chat.
- Do not claim unsupported JD requirements.
- Do not invent employers, dates, metrics, tools, certs, or education.
- If corpus is missing, run onboarding/import first.
- Do not add fluff: if a line does not support a JD requirement, omit it.

## Build workflow
1. Map JD requirements to evidence from corpus/chat.
2. Draft resume in template structure.
3. Ensure high-priority JD terms are present where truthful.
4. Present markdown draft for user review before export.
