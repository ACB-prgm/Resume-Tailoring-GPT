# Phase 1 - JD Analysis (Requirements-first)

## Objective
- Treat the JD as a requirements document, not marketing copy. Extract constraints, 
weighted requirements, and the hiring risk model before writing resume content.

## Rules
- Prioritize hard constraints and literal requirements.
- Do not infer unsupported claims.
- If a requirement is not supported, flag it as a gap.
- In the Binary Gates section, omit any gate not explicitly specified in the JD.
- Use marker statuses throughout the full analysis:
    - 🟢 solid matching corpus evidence
    - 🟡 mediocre/partial evidence alignment
    - 🔴 total gap (no supporting evidence)
