Major Systems/Projects at GT’s Living Foods (structured for reuse)
4.1 Temp Management System (Temp Ordering + Termination + Conversion Eligibility)
Business problem: Temp labor requests and offboarding lived in email; low visibility; missed steps; weak audit trail; conversion timing created avoidable agency royalty costs.
Solution: Power Apps + Power Automate system enabling:
* Manager temp requests → approval routing + manpower planning check
* Approved requests → automated outreach to talent agencies with relevant details
* Termination requests → HR approval + automated agency notification
* Hour tracking consolidation → automatic conversion eligibility detection
* Notifications to HR/managers when temps qualify; formal submission + approvals for conversion
Integrations: ADP (hours/time data)
Value/impact themes: reduces administrative churn, improves auditability, controls cost leakage via timely conversions, centralizes temp workforce management.
(LinkedIn-aligned related entries)
   * “Automated Temp Ordering System” (Power Apps/Power Automate) — ~1,900 hours/year administrative savings at $40/hr
   * “Temp-to-Permanent Employee Conversion System” — consolidated hours DB + eligibility calculation + manager-facing app; ~400 hours/year savings at $40/hr
4.2 Automated Overtime Reporting (ADP → SQL → Power BI → Daily Emails)
Business problem: Managers needed timely labor/overtime visibility; manual reporting didn’t scale.
Solution: Built an ETL flow that:
   * Extracts hours data from ADP on cadence
   * Uses Power Automate + Synapse Pipelines to load/maintain a SQL table
   * Powers a Power BI report and generates automated daily email reports to managers
Value/impact themes: proactive labor management, consistent metrics, reduced manual reporting.
4.3 Internal IT Hardware & Software Request System (with Automated Approvals)
Business problem: Hardware/software requests required manual routing; limited inventory transparency during approvals; downstream ticket creation required extra steps.
Solution: Power Apps + Power Automate system enabling:
      * Request intake (hardware/software) with structured fields
      * Integration to IT inventory data (from ticketing system) to show selectable options
      * Approval workflows that display inventory levels to approvers at decision-time
      * Automated ticket creation in HALO upon approval

Business problem: Promotion planning and execution requires tight coordination (Sales/Finance/Marketing/ERP). Off-the-shelf alternatives were expensive and less tailored.
Solution: Full-feature system built with Power Apps, Power Automate, Dataverse, Power BI, and D365FO:
         * Sales creates promotions; statuses tracked end-to-end
         * Promotional guideline checks enforced (validation gates + structured exceptions)
         * Approval workflows (finance review, send back for revisions, etc.)
         * Automatic creation of trade allowance agreements in D365FO upon approval
         * “Budget snapshot” capability: finance can capture full dataset snapshots at points in time for comparison

         * Tracks prorated spends, timing/Gantt-style views, and deduction progress
Value/impact themes: governance + speed, reduced errors, shared source of truth, and high ROI vs commercial solutions (“similar systems ~$200–300k”).
4.5 HR Offboarding & Onboarding Application
Business problem: HR needed formal tracking and workflow management for onboarding/offboarding with clear progress visibility and approvals.
Solution: Power Apps app supporting:
            * Structured task tracking and status visibility
            * Approvals where required
            * Automation for document-filling steps associated with onboarding/offboarding
Value/impact themes: reduced misses, standardized execution, audit-ready processes.

               * Approval workflow before publication
               * Standardized filing structure (by department + document type) AND tabular list views for fast discovery
               * Version history with comments, document IDs, approval dates, and tags
               * AI readiness through strict categorization and metadata hygiene
               * Integrated Copilot: employees can ask questions; copilot finds relevant docs and summarizes the relevant sections
Value/impact themes: institutional memory, compliance, faster onboarding/training, searchable knowledge base.
4.7 Contract Management Systems (HR + Marketing)
Business problem: Contracts needed controlled intake, signature workflow, storage, and renewal/expiration tracking.

                     * Power Automate + Synapse Pipelines ETL to load full historical dataset and keep it current
                     * Built analytical datasets including:
                     * PPA (Post Promotion Analysis) planned vs actuals dataset: lift, ROI, incremental sales
                     * Competitor dataset that predicts competitor promotion periods using probability distributions over store/week/product behavior
Value/impact themes: better planning, data-driven promo strategy, competitive intelligence.
4.9 “Synergy Atlas” Copilot (AI Idea Intake + Executive Summaries)
Business problem: AI ideas arrive unstructured; difficult to prompt for sufficient detail; hard to summarize for exec review.
Solution: Custom copilot functioning as a guided “chatbot form”:
                        * Probes users for complete, requirement-aligned submissions
                        * Saves outputs to a database for review
                        * Summarizes themes/results for executive visibility

4.11 JAMIE — Deduction Matching System (LLM OCR + Matching Algorithm + D365FO Creation)
Business problem: Manual deduction matching is slow and error-prone; customer backup documents vary widely in format.
Solution: Automated pipeline:
                           * Finance uploads customer backup PDFs
                           * AI/LLM-based OCR extracts key fields into JSON (robust across novel templates)
                           * Matching algorithm identifies best-fit deductions; system auto-creates deduction in D365FO when confidence is high
                           * Low-confidence cases become drafts for human review
Value/impact themes: accelerates deduction processing, reduces template brittleness, improves throughput and accuracy.
